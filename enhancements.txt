We added several image functions in addition to the required: Auto Contrast, Blur, Equalize, Find Edges, Flip, Invert, Sharpen, and Smooth. Our Red-eye function uses a complex algorithm to preserve colour data. The program has support for reading/writing to the most common image formats.

We added undo/redo functions for any modifications. There are prompts for saving when an image is discarded without saving.

We included a statusbar, which provides context-sensitive help, mouse coordinates, and selection rectangle dimensions. We made an eyedropper tool which picks out the colour of a selected pixel and displays its colour data on the toolbar. The selection rectangle accessible to almost every image function, so changes can be made to only part of an image.

We made the program look professional and closely resembling other image editors, hence most users should be familiar with the layout. We also streamlined the design using custom icons and logos.
